Description: This package provide program to conduct variable selection for quantile and robust mean regression \citep{sherwood2021}. The group lasso penalty \citep{yuan2006model}. The Huber loss is adopted so that the quantile check function can be approximated by the tilted Huber loss for computational efficiency and stability.
